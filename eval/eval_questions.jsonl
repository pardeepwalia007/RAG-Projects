{"id":"q07","question":"What are the prohibited analyses?","expected_route":"docs","reference":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Analyses involving customer behavior, profitability, and marketing attribution are strictly prohibited due to missing inputs and data scope limitations. KEY FINDINGS: • Customer churn, CLV, profitability, and marketing attribution are explicitly prohibited. • Metrics must not be used to infer customer behavior, marketing ROI, or profitability without supporting data. RISKS / LIMITATIONS: - No inferred customer behavior is permitted."}
